* Version 0.1.0 - First public release:
* OpenGL accelerated scope
* Custom widgets for level sliders (Offset, trigger, ...)
* Markers and a zoom option that enables a second magnified scope
* Basic export/print functionality
* Fully customizable colors for screen/print
* Spectrum graphs with selectable window function
* Tables around scopes viewing settings and measurement results
* Configurable digital phosphor mode
* Experimental fast rate and large buffer mode
* German translation

2010-07-10  Oliver Haag  <oliver.haag@gmail.com>
* Replaced HantekDSOIO and HantekDSOAThread by DsoControl class
* New namespace Hantek (in directory src/hantek):
*   Added Control class (Inherits DsoControl)
*   Moved all Hantek DSO specific conversions into Control class
*   Added Device class for handling usb transfers
*   Created types.cpp/types.h with various Hantek-specific types
*   USB transfers are handled by Control class, no direct access from elsewhere
*   libusb 1.0 is used by default (Uses 0.1 when LIBUSB_VERSION is set to 0)
* DsoControl class could control non-Hantek DSOs too
* Added reference level and minimum magnitude for spectrum analysis to settings
* Made lower timebases available
* Spectrum and math graphs can be shown without enabling the voltage graph too

* Documentation updated

* Completed libusb 0.1 downwards compatibility mode (env LIBUSB_VERSION=0)
* Bugfix: Grid of scopes drawn even if there aren't any graphs available

2010-08-22  Oliver Haag  <oliver.haag@gmail.com>
* Bugfix: Pretrigger position wasn't initialized correctly on startup
* Bugfix: Wrong samplerate values were sent to the oscilloscope

* Samplerate values sent to device are calculated now, only limited by hardware
* Added the samplerate formula to the documentation
* Documentation updated with additional information from Oleg
* Removed Oleg from AUTHORS

2010-08-29  Oliver Haag  <oliver.haag@gmail.com>
* DSO details are known after Hantek::Control::connectDevice() is executed
* Removed useless initialization in Hantek::Control
* DSO is started after the settings have been transferred
* Added additional debug messages when building as debug binary
* Added support for DSO-5200
