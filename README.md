OpenHantek6022 is a free software for **Hantek DSO6022** USB digital signal oscilloscopes that is actively developed on
[github.com/OpenHantek/OpenHantek6022](https://github.com/OpenHantek/OpenHantek6022) - but only for Hantek 6022BE/BL and compatible scopes (Voltcraft, Darkwire, Protek, Acetech, etc.).

**This project gives no support for its [currently unmaintained](https://github.com/OpenHantek/openhantek/issues/277) predecessor [openhantek](https://github.com/OpenHantek/openhantek).**

## About OpenHantek6022
* Supported devices:
  - Hantek 6022BE and 6022BL as well as compatible scopes (e.g. Voltcraft DSO-2020).
  - SainSmart DDS120 (thx [msiegert](https://github.com/msiegert)) - this device has a different analog front end
 and uses the [slightly improved sigrok firmware](https://github.com/Ho-Ro/sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw), which has [some limitations](https://sigrok.org/wiki/SainSmart_DDS120/Info#Open-source_firmware_details)
 compared to the Hantek scopes (see [#69](https://github.com/OpenHantek/OpenHantek6022/issues/69#issuecomment-607341694)).

* Demo mode is provided by the `-d` or `--demoMode` command line option.
* Fully supported operating system: Linux; developed under debian stable (currently *bullseye*) for amd64 architecture.
* Raspberry Pi packages (raspbian stable) are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/OpenHantek/OpenHantek6022/releases) page, check this [setup requirement](docs/build.md#raspberrypi).
* Compiles under FreeBSD (packaging / installation: work in progress, thx [tspspi](https://github.com/tspspi)).
* Other operating systems builds: [Windows](docs/images/screenshot_mainwindow_win.png) (mostly untested) & macOS (completely untested).
  **No support for non-Linux related issues unless a volunteer steps in!**
* Uses [free open source firmware](https://github.com/Ho-Ro/Hantek6022API), no longer dependent on nonfree Hantek firmware.
* Extensive [User Manual](docs/OpenHantek6022_User_Manual.pdf) with technical specs and schematics.

## Features

  This allows a minimum window size of 800*300 for old laptops or workstation computers.
* All settings can be saved to a configuration file and loaded again.
* Chinese, French, German, Polish, Russian and Spanish localisation complete, Italian and Portuguese translation ongoing - [volunteers welcome](openhantek/translations/Translation_HowTo.md)!

## AC coupling
A [little HW modification](docs/HANTEK6022_AC_Modification.pdf) adds AC coupling. OpenHantek6022 supports this feature since v2.17-rc5 / FW0204.

## Continuous Integration
Every commit triggers a workflow on
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/OpenHantek/OpenHantek6022/actions/workflows/build_check.yml)
that builds and packages OpenHantek6022 for:
* Linux (`*.deb`, `*.rpm`, `*.tar.gz`)
* macOS (`*.dmg`, `*.tar.gz`)
* Windows (`*.zip`)

[![GitHub CI](https://github.com/OpenHantek/OpenHantek6022/actions/workflows/build_check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OpenHantek/OpenHantek6022/actions/workflows/build_check.yml)
This status badge here (and on top) show the build status.

## Building OpenHantek6022 from source
The preferred way to run OpenHantek6022 is to build it from source on your system, especially under Linux.

The easiest way to get an up-to-date working code base is to clone the code from here via

````git clone https://github.com/OpenHantek/OpenHantek6022.git````

and then build it locally, for this you will need the following software:
* [CMake 3.5+](https://cmake.org/download/)
* [Qt 5.4+](https://www1.qt.io/download-open-source/)
* [FFTW 3+](http://www.fftw.org/) (prebuild files will be downloaded on windows)
* [libusb-1.0](https://libusb.info/), version >= 1.0.16 (prebuild files will be used on windows)
* A compiler that supports C++11 - tested with gcc, clang and msvc

We have build instructions available for [Linux](docs/build.md#linux), [Raspberry Pi](docs/build.md#raspberrypi), [FreeBSD](docs/build.md#freebsd), [Apple macOS](docs/build.md#macos) and [Microsoft Windows](docs/build.md#windows).

To make building for Linux even easier, I provide two shell scripts:
* [`LinuxSetup_AsRoot`](LinuxSetup_AsRoot), which installs all build requirements. You only need to call this script once (as root) if you have cloned the project.
* [`LinuxBuild`](LinuxBuild) configures the build, builds the binary and finally creates the packages (deb, rpm and tgz) that can be installed as described in the next paragraph.
If you make small changes to the local source code, it is sufficient to call `make -j4` or `fakeroot make -j4 package` in the `build` directory.

## Install prebuilt binary packages
* Download Linux (built on Ubuntu 1804 LTS), Raspberry Pi (Debian stable), FreeBSD (12.1), macOS (Catalina 10.15) and Windows (Visual Studio 2019) packages for your convenience from the [Releases](https://github.com/OpenHantek/OpenHantek6022/releases) page.
* If you want to follow ongoing development, packages built from a fairly recent commit are available in the [unstable release](https://github.com/OpenHantek/OpenHantek6022/releases/tag/unstable).
* For RPi4 see also [issue #28](https://github.com/OpenHantek/OpenHantek6022/issues/28).
* These binary packages are built on stable operating system versions and require an up-to-date system.
* As I develop on a *Debian stable* system my preferred (native) package format is `*.deb`.
The program itself and the `*.deb` package built on my local system is tested for completeness and correctness.
The precompiled packages are only randomly tested - if at all - and the installation of the `*.rpm` packages is untested.
* To install the downloaded `*.deb` package, open a terminal window, go to the package directory and enter the command (as root) `apt install ./openhantek_..._amd64.deb`.
This command will automatically install all dependencies of the program as well.
* For installation of `*.rpm` packages follow similar rules, e.g. `dnf install ./openhantek-...-1.x86_64.rpm`.
* The `*.tar.gz` achives contain the same files as the `*.deb` and `*.rpm` packages for quick testing - do not use for a permanent installation. Do not report any issues about the `*.tar.gz`!
* Get macOS packages from [macports](https://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=name&substr=openhantek) - thx [ra1nb0w](https://github.com/ra1nb0w).
* Get [Fedora rpm packages](https://pkgs.org/download/openhantek) - thx [Vascom](https://github.com/Vascom).
* Download [(untested) builds from last commit(s)](https://github.com/OpenHantek/OpenHantek6022/actions/workflows/build_check.yml). Select the preferred `workflow run` and go to `Artifacts`.

## Run OpenHantek6022
On a Linux system start the program via the menu entry *OpenHantek (Digital Storage Oscilloscope)* or from a terminal window as `OpenHantek`.

You can explore the look and feel of OpenHantek6022 without the need for real scope hardware by running it from the command line as: `OpenHantek --demoMode`.

Note: To use the 6022BL in scope mode, make sure the "H/P" button is pressed before plugging in.

### OpenGL support
OpenHantek6022 uses the *OpenGL* graphics library to display the data. It requires a graphics card that supports
3D rendering and runs on legacy HW/SW that supports at least *OpenGL* 2.1+ or *OpenGL ES* 1.2+.
*OpenGL* is selected by default, but if this does not work (i.e. the black scope window shows an error message
or closes immediately after startup), you can choose the less resource-hungry *OpenGL ES* variant as a fallback
by starting OpenHantek from the command line as follows: `OpenHantek -e` or `OpenHantek --useGLES`.

Especially on Windows, this option may be necessary to use the program.

The Raspberry Pi build uses OpenGL ES automatically, check also the [graphics driver setup](docs/build.md#raspberrypi).

### USB access
USB access for the device is required (unless using demo mode):
* **_Linux/Unix_**  
You need to copy the file `utils/udev_rules/60-openhantek.rules` to `/etc/udev/rules.d/` or `/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/` and replug your device.
Note: If OpenHantek is installed from a `*.deb` or `*.rpm` package this file is installed automatically into `/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/`.
* **_Windows_**  
__Caution: The original Hantek driver for Windows doesn't work!__  
You have to assign the correct WinUSB driver with _one_ of these three _alternatives_:
  1. Install the individual signed `.inf` files `Hantek_6022Bx_xxxxxx.inf` [provided by fgrieu](https://github.com/OpenHantek/OpenHantek6022/pull/251), part of `openhantek_xxx_win_x64.zip` [binary distribution](https://github.com/OpenHantek/OpenHantek6022/releases). 
  You can also download them as a [zip](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/OpenHantek/OpenHantek6022/tree/main/utils/signed-windows-inf-files)
  (or individually with associated `.cat` from [utils/signed-windows-inf-files](https://github.com/OpenHantek/OpenHantek6022/tree/main/utils/signed-windows-inf-files)). Select the desired `Hantek_6022Bx_xxxxxx.inf` files (the 3 with the device name "BE" or "BL", or all 6) and select "install" from the pull-down menu. 
  2. Install the signed `.inf` file `Hantek_6022B.inf` for all devices [provided by VictorEEV](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/hantek-6022be-20mhz-usb-dso/msg3218116/#msg3218116). It's also part of the `openhantek_xxx_win_x64.zip` [binary distribution](https://github.com/OpenHantek/OpenHantek6022/releases). Right-click on `Hantek_6022B.inf` and select "install" from the pull-down menu.
  3. Run the [**Zadig**](docs/build.md#microsoft-windows-usb-driver-install-with-zadig) tool and follow the good [step-by-step tutorial](docs/OpenHantek6022_zadig_Win10.pdf) provided by [DaPa](https://github.com/DaPa).

  Note:  
  With alternative *i*, the Device Manager will show (under "Universal Serial Bus devices") the name and state according to the firmware loaded (e.g. `Hantek 6022BE loader`, `Hantek 6022BL openht`).  
  The [PulseView/sigrok-cli](https://sigrok.org/) firmware is also recognized (e.g. `Hantek 6022BE sigrok`).

## Important!
The scope doesn't store the firmware permanently in flash or eeprom, it must be uploaded after each power-up and is kept in ram 'til power-down.
If the scope was used with a different software (old openhantek, sigrok or the windows software) the scope must be unplugged and replugged one-time before using it with OpenHantek6022 to enable the automatic loading of the correct firmware.
The top line of the program must display the correct firmware version (FW0209).

## Specifications, features, limitations and developer documentation
I use this project mainly to explore how DSP software can improve and extend the [limitations](docs/limitations.md)
of this kind of low level hardware. It would have been easy to spend a few bucks more to buy a powerful scope - but it would be much less fun :)
Please refer also to the [developer info](docs/developer_info.md).

## History
The program was initially developed by [David GrÃ¤ff and others](https://github.com/OpenHantek/openhantek/graphs/contributors)
on [github.com/OpenHantek/openhantek](https://github.com/OpenHantek/openhantek),
but David [stopped maintaining](https://github.com/OpenHantek/openhantek/issues/277) the programm in December 2018.
